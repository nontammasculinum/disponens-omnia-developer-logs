			<h1>Compilers with non-tam-masculinum</h1>
			<h3>part 1: the language</h3>
		</heading>
		<paragraph>
			<p>
				To whom it may concern<br/>
				I am designing and building a programming language, in this series I will chronical my journey from nothing to not nothing
				. This series will end when I have a working compiler and likely will only be released by then as well.<br/>
				I should start with the language I will be developing, by name it shall be reffered to as disponens omnia, latin for arranging everything, and by
				value it shall be known as the minimalist language. It was designed by removing as many language features from C as possible until it becomes
				incredibly difficult to write code that will make me weep. Now you may wonder the benefits of such a language, and simply put you get easily debugged
				and (hopefully) followed code. For example a in C a fibonacci function would look like this:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
int fibonacci(int x) {
	int t1 = 0, t2 = 1, nt = t1 + t2;
	for(int i = 3; i &lt;= x; i++) {
		t1 = t2;
		t2 = nt;
		nt = t1 + t2;
	}
	return nt;
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				And in disponens omnia it would look more like this:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
int fibonacci(int c) {
	if(c &lt; 2) return(1);
	return(fibonacci(c - 1, c - 2));
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				Of course you can write the same function in C, but in disponens omnia it is the only way to write it. The pro of having more features is having
				more, easier to understand ways to do things, but the con of having more features if having more, less readable ways to do things.<br/>
				Disponens omnia has 10 keywords
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
int
char
float
struct
enum
union
if
else
mut
return
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				Among these keywords there are three datatypes three complex datatypes three control flow operations and one datatype manipulation keyword.
				int, char, and float are datatypes. Datatypes are the types of variables you can have, int is for whole numbers, short for integer, char is
				a one byte integer that is interpereted as ascii characters, short for character, and float is for decimal numbers, short for floating point.
				ints and floats take up four bytes of space and char takes up one. struct, enum, and union are complex datatypes. These are datatypes that are
				not of the three simple ones (int, char, and float). struct is a datatype that holds other datatypes, for example:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
struct entity {
	int x;
	int y;
	int radius;
};
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				You can get the data from a struct using the syntax "struct_name.value_name" like so:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
mut struct entity e;
e.x = 10;
e.y = 10;
e.radius = 3;
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				These structs are simply containers for related values to be grouped together. An enum is a wrapper for the int datatype in which every value has a
				name, for example:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
enum time {
	time_year=31536000,
	time_week=604800,
	time_day=86400,
	time_hour=3600,
	time_minute=60,
	time_second=1,
	time_millisecond=0.001
};
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				enums are used to avoid magic numbers for example the enum above can be used to calculate the number of seconds from a specific time like so:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
int seconds_from_time(int milliseconds, int seconds, int minute, int hour, int day, int week, int year) {
	return(milliseconds * time_millisecod + \
		   seconds * time_second + \
		   minute * time_minute + \
		   hour * time_hour + \
		   day * time_day + \
		   week * time_week + \
		   year * time_week);
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				unions sound useless but are not somehow, they are essentially a struct that can only store one of its values. For example we could be making an
				interpereter for a language, we could store a seperate array for each type but that would be ineffecient to search through. Instead we would have
				a union named value which could then be placed in a struct var which can then be put in an array. This would be done as such:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
union value {
	int i;
	char c;
	float f;
};
struct var {
	union value val;
	char *name;
};
mut struct var stack[100];
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				We then have the control flow keywords, you do not have a turing complete programming language if you dont have a way to control flow. I have found
				that we only need three to make a usable programming language, if, else, return. If statements simply take an expression and if it evaluates 0 then
				it skips the code in its block, else it skips its block and goes to the next else block (provided there is one) its block, for example:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
if(x &lt; 10) {
	y = x * 12;
} else {
	y = x * 6;
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				note that just as c does if/else blocks can be implied so that only one line is used, which allows for if else statements like so:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
if(x &lt; 10) y = x * 12;
else if(x &lt; 20) y = x * 6;
else y = x * 3;
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				which is equivalent to:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
if(x &lt; 10) {
	y = x * 12;
} else {
	if(x &lt; 20) {
		y = x * 6;
	} else {
		y = x * 3;
	}
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				The final control flow keyword is return, which is a bit of a special case. In disponens omnia you can have functions, and these functions can be
				called to complete the code in its block, which can also evaluate to some type, to display this we shall analyse a constructor function for an
				entity struct:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
struct entity {
	int x;
	int y;
	int r;
};
struct entity /*this is the type that the function returns*/ entity_new /*the name*/ (int x, int y, int r) /* the parameters to be passed in */ {
	struct entity ret;
	ret.x = x;
	ret.y = y;
	ret.r = r;
	return(ret); /*This places you back to the place of calling and evaluates the function to ret*/
}

int main() /*main is the entry point of our program*/ {
	struct entity e = entity_new(0, 20, 3); /*this will set e to the value that entity_new evaluates to with the parameters x: 0, y: 20, r: 3 returns*/
	return 0; /*0 is the successful run value*/
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				You may have noticed that we do not have a control flow operation for loops, this is because we can use functions to do the same thing with less
				state change! Why though you ask would we need to minimize state change. Well when we change the state of a function we need to take that change into
				account when reading and debugging, which is fine for smaller statements, but for large amounts of state change, the number of things to think about
				exponentially increases. A loop that simply adds all the elements of an array would look like this in C:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
int main() {
	int k = 0;
	int a[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
	for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
		k += a[i];
	}
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				and in disponens omnia it looks like so:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
int sum(int a[], int i) {
	if(i - 1 == 0) return a[0];
	return sum(a, i - 1) + a[i - 1];
}
int main() {
	int a[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
	int k = sum(a, 10);
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				In the C program we change state 20 times, each time we iterate i and each time we add a[i] to k, but in the disponens omnia we dont change state.
				This is because we instead create a new state that evaluates to some value. This is good because we only need to make sure that one state per edge
				case is viable, rather than multiple states per every edge case, there is just less that needs to be thought about. And yet again you can write these
				functions in c but you cannot write the loops in disponens omnia, less ways to fail.<br/>
				Now finally we have the mut keyword, categorised as a datatype modifier, it exists as the only compromise in value. The mut keyword is the opposite of
				the const keyword in c, it allows you to change variables which by default you cannot do. This means that variables start as constants, causing you
				to think just a little bit more about whether or not a value should change state. It is used like this:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
int function(int k) {
	return k + 13 * k;
}
int main() {
	mut int k = 10;
	k = function(k);
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				You can only change a mutable value in the state it was created, this means that functions cannot change a value placed inside of it, this just makes
				tracking variable change easier, simply put this wouldnt compile:
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
int function(mut int k) {
	k += 13 * k;
}
</code>
</pre>
			<p>
				That wraps up keywords, which leads us into operations.
			</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-c line-numbers">
a + b // evaluate to a add b
a - b // evaluate to a subtract b
a * b // evaluate to a multiplied by b
a / b // evaluate to a divided by b
a, b // evaluate a and b and evaluate to b
a.b // get the value of name b from struct/union a
a &amp; b // for all bits of a and b if both of the corresponding bits is one the evaluated value will have a corresponding bit of one
a | b // for all bits of a and b if any of the corresponding bits is one the evaluated value will have a corresponding bit of one
a ^ b // for all bits of a and b if only one bit is one the evaluated value will have a corresponding bit of one
~a // flips all the bits of a
!a // if a is not zero, evaluate zero, else evaluate 1
a = b // sets the value of a to b and evaluates to b
a == b // if a is equal to b evaluate 1 else evaluate 0
a != b // if a is not equal to b evaluate to 1 else 0
a &lt; b // evaluates 1 if a is lesser than b else 0
a &gt; b // evaluates 1 if a is greater than b else 0
a &amp;&amp; b // evaluates 1 if both a and b evaluate to non zero, else evaluates 0
a || b // evaluates 1 if either a or b evaluate to non zero, else evaluates 0
(a) // a will happen before outside expressions
a[b] // gets valyue at index b from a
{a} // creates a block in which all variables created in code a are deleted when the block is exited
</code>

				These are the specs of disponens omnia that I will be building a compiler for, and this is the end of part one.<br/>
